## üîç Detailed Gap Analysis

### üü° Major Gaps (1 Item)

#### GAP-001: API Specification Granularity
**Category:** Technical Specification  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Medium  

**Current State:**
- High-level API architecture described
- Endpoint patterns mentioned in PRP
- No formal OpenAPI specification

**Gap Description:**
The specifications lack detailed API documentation including:
- Request/response schemas
- Error response formats
- Authentication mechanisms
- Rate limiting specifics
- Validation rules

**Recommendation:**
Create comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification with:
```yaml
# Example enhancement needed
/tournaments/{id}/join:
  post:
    summary: Join tournament
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          type: string
          format: uuid
    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              userId:
                type: integer
                format: int64
            required: [userId]
    responses:
      200:
        description: Successfully joined tournament
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/TournamentJoinResponse'
      400:
        description: Invalid request or tournament full
      404:
        description: Tournament not found
```

**Implementation Priority:** Week 1 of development

  type: 'game-update' | 'tournament-update' | 'match-result' | 'error';
  timestamp: number;
  data: GameUpdateData | TournamentUpdateData | MatchResultData | ErrorData;
}

interface GameUpdateData {
  gameId: string;
  round: number;
  scores: [number, number];
  status: 'active' | 'completed';

  'tournament_completion_rate': {
    description: 'Percentage of tournaments completed successfully',
    threshold: 0.95,
    alert: 'critical'
  },
  'average_response_time': {
    description: 'Average bot response time in milliseconds',
    threshold: 200,
    alert: 'warning'
  },
  'concurrent_active_games': {
    description: 'Number of simultaneously active games',
    threshold: 100,
    alert: 'info'
  }
};
```

#### GAP-005: Internationalization Requirements
**Category:** User Experience  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Impact:** Low
