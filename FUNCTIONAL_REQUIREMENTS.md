## 3. Game Flow and Tournament Mechanics

### 3.1 Tournament Creation Flow

```
1. Admin initiates tournament → /create_tournament
2. System creates bracket structure (up to 16 players)
3. Registration period begins (configurable duration)
4. Players join → /join_tournament
5. Tournament starts when bracket is full or time expires
6. System generates first round matches
```

### 3.2 Match Flow (Best of 3)

```
1. System notifies both players of match start
2. Players privately submit their choice → /play [rock|paper|scissors]
3. System reveals choices and determines winner
4. If series not complete (< 2 wins), repeat step 2
5. System declares match winner and updates bracket
6. Advance winner to next round
```

### 3.3 Tournament Progression

```
1. All first round matches complete
2. System automatically creates second round matches
3. Process continues until final match
4. Crown tournament champion
5. Display final results and statistics
```

### 3.4 Bracket Management

- **Single Elimination**: Standard tournament bracket
- **Seeding**: Players seeded based on join order or admin assignment
- **Bye Rounds**: Handle uneven participant numbers
- **Bracket Visualization**: ASCII art representation updated in real-time

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### 4.1 Tournament Creation (US-008)

**Given** I am a group admin  
**When** I use the `/create_tournament` command  
**Then** the system should:
- Create a new tournament instance
- Set registration period (default 5 minutes, configurable)
- Display tournament ID and join instructions
- Show empty bracket structure

**And** the tournament should accept up to 16 participants

### 4.2 Player Registration (US-001)

**Given** a tournament is in registration phase  
**When** a user sends `/join_tournament`  
**Then** the system should:
- Add player to tournament roster
- Update bracket visualization
- Confirm registration to player
- Notify if tournament is full

**And** players cannot join twice

### 4.3 Match Execution (US-002)

**Given** a match is active  
**When** both players submit their choices  
**Then** the system should:
- Compare choices using RPS rules
- Determine round winner
- Display result to all participants
- Update match score (best of 3)
- Advance to next round or declare match winner

### 4.4 Bracket Visualization (US-005)

**Given** a tournament is active  
**When** any user requests `/bracket`  
**Then** the system should:
- Display ASCII bracket with current state
- Show player names and match results
- Highlight active matches
- Update in real-time as matches complete

### 4.5 Admin Controls (US-010)

**Given** I am a tournament admin  
**When** I use admin commands  
**Then** I should be able to:
- `/pause_tournament` - Pause all matches
- `/resume_tournament` - Resume paused tournament
- `/cancel_tournament` - Cancel tournament with confirmation
- `/force_match [player1] [player2]` - Force match result
- `/remove_player [username]` - Remove player from tournament

## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints

### 5.1 Technical Constraints

- **Maximum Players**: 16 per tournament
- **Concurrent Tournaments**: 1 per Telegram group
- **Match Timeout**: 5 minutes per choice submission
- **Database**: Redis for session storage, persistent storage for results
- **Message Rate Limits**: Respect Telegram API limits

### 5.2 Edge Cases

**EC-001: Player Disconnection**
- **Scenario**: Player doesn't respond within timeout
- **Handling**: Automatic forfeit after 5 minutes, advance opponent

**EC-002: Bot Restart During Tournament**
- **Scenario**: Bot service restarts mid-tournament
- **Handling**: Restore tournament state from Redis, notify participants

**EC-003: Uneven Participants**
- **Scenario**: Tournament starts with odd number of players
- **Handling**: Highest seed gets bye to next round

**EC-004: Admin Abuse Prevention**
- **Scenario**: Admin tries to manipulate results
- **Handling**: Log all admin actions, require confirmation for destructive operations

**EC-005: Duplicate Submissions**
- **Scenario**: Player submits choice multiple times
- **Handling**: Accept first valid submission, ignore subsequent attempts

**EC-006: Group Member Leaves**
- **Scenario**: Tournament participant leaves Telegram group
- **Handling**: Automatically forfeit all remaining matches

**EC-007: Simultaneous Tournament Creation**
- **Scenario**: Multiple admins try to create tournaments
- **Handling**: Allow only one active tournament per group

### 5.3 Data Integrity Constraints

- All match results must be immutable once recorded
- Tournament brackets must maintain referential integrity
- Player statistics must be consistently updated
- Admin actions must be logged and auditable

### 5.4 Performance Constraints
