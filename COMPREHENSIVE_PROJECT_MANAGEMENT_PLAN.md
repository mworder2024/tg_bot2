 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const bracketManager = new TournamentBracketManager();
 * const bracket = await bracketManager.generateBracket({
 *   players: registeredPlayers,
 *   eliminationType: 'single',
 *   seedingAlgorithm: 'standard'
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @see {@link ITournamentBracket} for bracket interface
 */
export class TournamentBracketManager implements ITournamentBracket {
  /**
   * Generates tournament bracket with seeding
   * 
   * @param options - Bracket generation configuration
   * @param options.players - Array of registered players
   * @param options.eliminationType - Tournament elimination type
   * @param options.seedingAlgorithm - Player seeding strategy

### Security Configuration
**Production security hardening:**

```typescript
// Security middleware configuration
import helmet from 'helmet';
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

export const securityConfig = {
  // Rate limiting
  rateLimit: rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    message: 'Too many requests from this IP',
  }),

  // Security headers
  helmet: helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
        connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss:", "https:"],
      },
    },
    hsts: {
      maxAge: 31536000,
      includeSubDomains: true,
      preload: true
    }
  }),

  // Input validation
  validation: {
    whitelist: true,
    forbidNonWhitelisted: true,
    transform: true,
