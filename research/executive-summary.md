```typescript
// Blockchain Integration
Blockchain: TON (native Telegram integration)
Tokens: Jettons (following $2B Notcoin success)
Wallets: TON Connect (seamless Telegram UX)
Smart Contracts: TypeScript (Gala Games innovation)
```

**Market Opportunity:**
- **TON Ecosystem:** 5.7M daily transactions, growing rapidly
- **Telegram Access:** Direct access to 800M+ users
- **GameFi Trend:** 28.5% CAGR through 2032

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-16)
```typescript
// Full GameFi Platform
NFTs: Tournament achievements (The Sandbox pattern)
DeFi: Staking for entry fees (Axie Infinity model)
Governance: DAO tournament rules
Cross-chain: Multi-blockchain support
```

## Architecture Decision Matrix

### Database Choice: PostgreSQL ✅
| Factor | PostgreSQL | MongoDB |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Tournament Integrity | ✅ ACID compliance | ❌ Eventual consistency |
| Complex Queries | ✅ SQL joins for leaderboards | ❌ Complex aggregations |
| Proven at Scale | ✅ The Sandbox success | ⚠️ Limited GameFi usage |
| **Recommendation** | **SELECTED** | Not recommended |

### Real-time Solution: Socket.io ✅
| Factor | Socket.io | Native WebSocket |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Reliability | ✅ HTTP fallback | ❌ Connection drops |
| Room Management | ✅ Tournament lobbies | ❌ Manual implementation |
| Broadcast Features | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Custom solution |
| **Recommendation** | **SELECTED** | Not recommended |

### Bot Framework: Grammy ✅
| Factor | Grammy | node-telegram-bot-api |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| NestJS Integration | ✅ Official support | ❌ Manual integration |
| TypeScript Native | ✅ Built for TS | ⚠️ Type definitions |
| Modern Features | ✅ Latest Telegram API | ❌ Slower updates |
| **Recommendation** | **SELECTED** | Legacy choice |

## Performance Benchmarks & Targets

### Concurrent User Scaling Plan
```
Phase 1 (MVP):        1K users  → NestJS monolith
Phase 2 (Growth):    10K users  → Microservices
Phase 3 (Scale):    100K users  → Event-driven
Phase 4 (Mass):     1M+ users   → State channels
```

### Response Time Requirements
- **Bot Commands:** <50ms (Telegram standard)
- **Database Queries:** <10ms (optimized PostgreSQL)
- **Real-time Updates:** <100ms (Socket.io WebSocket)
- **Leaderboard Refresh:** <5ms (Redis cache)

### Economic Model Projections
Based on successful GameFi projects:
- **Notcoin Achievement:** $2B market cap from simple gameplay
