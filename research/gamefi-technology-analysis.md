**2024 Event Performance:**
- 580,000+ unique players in single event
- 1.4M hours played
- 49M quests completed
- $2.5M SAND reward distribution

### Telegram GameFi (Mass Market)
| Component | Technology | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Frontend | Telegram Mini Apps (JavaScript) | 800M+ user base access |
| Real-time | WebSocket + Socket.io fallback | <50ms latency globally |
| Blockchain | TON | 5.7M daily transactions, 500K active wallets |
| Architecture | Bot-based games | No downloads required |

**Success Examples:**
- **Hamster Kombat:** 60M users in 3 months
- **Notcoin:** $2B market cap, millions of DAU
- **150M+ players** across major Telegram games

## 2. Recommended Stack for Telegram RPS Tournament Bot

### Core Architecture (NestJS + Grammy + TypeScript)
```typescript
// Optimal stack identified from research
Backend Framework: NestJS (modular, scalable)
Bot Framework: Grammy (official NestJS integration)
Language: TypeScript (industry standard in GameFi 2024)
Database: PostgreSQL (consistency for tournaments)
Real-time: Socket.io (with WebSocket fallback)
Caching: Redis (leaderboards, sessions)
Blockchain: TON (Telegram native, 1M+ TPS)
```
