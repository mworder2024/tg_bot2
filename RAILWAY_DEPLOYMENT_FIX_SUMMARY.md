# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Start Command Path** ✅
- **Problem**: Railway was trying to run `node dist/main.js` but the compiled file is at `dist/main`
- **Fix**: Updated `railway.toml` to use `node dist/main`

### 2. **Environment Variables** ✅
- **Problem**: Config validation was expecting many environment variables not needed for MVP
- **Fix**: Updated `config.validation.mvp.ts` to:
  - Make `BOT_TOKEN` and `JWT_SECRET` required only in production
  - Add defaults for admin configuration
  - Make Redis-related configs optional

### 3. **Simplified .env.example** ✅
- **Problem**: Example file had too many variables for MVP
- **Fix**: Simplified to only include required variables:
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `PORT=3000`
  - `BOT_TOKEN` (required)
  - `JWT_SECRET` (required)

## Environment Variables for Railway

In your Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

```bash
# Required
BOT_TOKEN=8121322920:AAFQ5jSf_aaVj9e6e_joWAkQ1ptI1srICok
JWT_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
NODE_ENV=production

# Railway provides automatically
# PORT=<provided by Railway>
# DATABASE_URL=<provided by PostgreSQL addon>
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Railway Dashboard**:
   - Your project should auto-deploy on push
   - If not, click "Deploy" → "Deploy Now"

3. **Monitor deployment**:
   - Check build logs for compilation
   - Check deploy logs for startup
   - Look for: "RPS Tournament Bot is running on port"

4. **Verify deployment**:
   - Health check: `https://[your-app].railway.app/api/v1/ping`
   - Bot should respond to `/start` in Telegram

## What Changed

1. **railway.toml**: Fixed start command path
2. **config.validation.mvp.ts**: Made production-friendly with proper defaults
3. **.env.example**: Simplified for easier deployment setup

## Next Steps

1. Generate and set JWT_SECRET in Railway
2. Ensure BOT_TOKEN is set correctly
3. Deploy and monitor logs
4. Test bot functionality

The deployment should now work correctly on Railway!
