- [ ] JWT_SECRET - Random secure string
- [ ] NODE_ENV - Set to "production"
- [ ] DATABASE_URL - Automatically provided by Railway

## Webhook Configuration (Optional)
If you want to use webhooks instead of polling:
1. Get your Railway app URL: `railway open`
2. Set webhook URL:
```bash
railway variables set BOT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/bot/webhook
railway variables set BOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify BOT_TOKEN is set correctly
3. Ensure the bot module is enabled in app.module.ts

### Database Connection Issues
1. DATABASE_URL is automatically provided by Railway
2. Check if migrations ran successfully
3. Verify PostgreSQL addon is attached

### Health Check Failing
- The app exposes `/api/v1/ping` for health checks
- If failing, check application logs

## Quick Deploy Commands
```bash
# One-liner deploy after setup
git add . && git commit -m "Deploy update" && railway up
```

## Monitoring
- View logs: `railway logs -f`
- Check metrics: `railway open` â†’ Metrics tab
- Database console: `railway connect postgres`

## Important Notes
1. The bot will use **polling mode** by default on Railway
2. No need to worry about Node.js networking issues on Railway
3. Railway provides free tier with 500 hours/month
4. PostgreSQL database is included with automatic backups
