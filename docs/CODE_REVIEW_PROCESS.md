### 4. Review Execution

#### Review Timeline
- **Standard PRs**: 24-48 hours for initial review
- **Urgent PRs**: 4-8 hours for initial review
- **Hotfixes**: 1-2 hours for initial review
- **Documentation**: 24 hours for initial review

#### Review Levels

##### Level 1: Automated Checks (Required)
All automated checks must pass before human review:
```yaml
# Required Status Checks
- ‚úÖ CI/CD Pipeline Passed
- ‚úÖ Unit Tests (85%+ coverage)
- ‚úÖ Integration Tests
- ‚úÖ Linting and Formatting
- ‚úÖ TypeScript Compilation
- ‚úÖ Security Scan
- ‚úÖ Performance Benchmarks
```

##### Level 2: Human Review (Required)

**Code Structure and Design**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Single Responsibility Principle
class GameService {
  async createGame(dto: CreateGameDto): Promise<Game> {
    // Only handles game creation logic
  }
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Multiple responsibilities
class GameService {
  async createGame(dto: CreateGameDto): Promise<Game> {
    // Game creation + user validation + tournament logic
  }
}
```

**Error Handling**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper error handling with context
async processMove(gameId: string, playerId: string, move: RPSMove): Promise<GameResult> {
  try {
    const game = await this.gameRepository.findOne({ id: gameId });
    if (!game) {
      throw new NotFoundException(`Game with ID ${gameId} not found`);
    }
    
    return await this.gameEngine.processMove(game, playerId, move);
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Failed to process move for game ${gameId}`, error);
    throw new InternalServerErrorException('Failed to process game move');
  }
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Generic error handling
async processMove(gameId: string, playerId: string, move: RPSMove): Promise<GameResult> {
  try {
    // logic here
  } catch (error) {
    throw error; // No context or logging
  }
}
```

**Performance Considerations**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Efficient database queries
async getUserGames(userId: string): Promise<Game[]> {
  return this.gameRepository.find({
    where: [
      { player1: { id: userId } },
      { player2: { id: userId } }
    ],
    relations: ['player1', 'player2'],
    order: { createdAt: 'DESC' },
    take: 50
  });
}

// ‚ùå Bad: N+1 query problem
async getUserGames(userId: string): Promise<Game[]> {
  const games = await this.gameRepository.find({ userId });
  for (const game of games) {
    game.player1 = await this.userRepository.findOne(game.player1Id);
    game.player2 = await this.userRepository.findOne(game.player2Id);
  }
  return games;
}
```

##### Level 3: Domain Expert Review (Conditional)
Required for complex business logic changes:
- Game rule modifications
- Tournament bracket algorithms
- Scoring and ranking systems
- Payment or reward logic

### 5. Review Comments and Feedback

#### Comment Categories

##### üî¥ Must Fix (Blocking)
Issues that must be resolved before merge:
```markdown
üî¥ **Must Fix**: This method can cause a race condition when multiple players 
join the same tournament simultaneously. Please add proper locking mechanism.

```typescript
// Current code
async joinTournament(tournamentId: string, playerId: string) {
  const tournament = await this.findById(tournamentId);
  if (tournament.currentParticipants < tournament.maxParticipants) {
    tournament.currentParticipants++;
    await this.save(tournament);
  }
}
```

Suggested fix:
```typescript
async joinTournament(tournamentId: string, playerId: string) {
  return this.dataSource.transaction(async manager => {
    const tournament = await manager.findOne(Tournament, {
      where: { id: tournamentId },
      lock: { mode: 'pessimistic_write' }
    });
    
    if (tournament.currentParticipants >= tournament.maxParticipants) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Tournament is full');
    }
    
    tournament.currentParticipants++;
    return manager.save(tournament);
  });
}
```

##### üü° Should Fix (Non-blocking)
Improvements that should be addressed but don't block merge:
```markdown
üü° **Should Fix**: Consider extracting this validation logic into a separate 
validator class for better reusability and testing.

Current approach works but could be improved for maintainability.
```

##### üîµ Suggestion (Optional)
Nice-to-have improvements:
```markdown
üîµ **Suggestion**: You might want to consider using an enum for these magic 
strings to improve type safety:

```typescript
enum GameStatus {
  WAITING = 'waiting',
  ACTIVE = 'active',
  COMPLETED = 'completed'
}
```

##### üí° Question/Discussion
Seeking clarification or starting discussion:
```markdown
üí° **Question**: What happens if a player disconnects during a tournament match? 
Should we implement an auto-forfeit after a timeout period?

This might be worth discussing with the product team.
```

##### ‚úÖ Praise
Acknowledging good practices:
```markdown
‚úÖ **Great Work**: Excellent error handling and logging here. The error messages 
are clear and actionable for debugging.
```

#### Comment Best Practices

**DO:**
- Be specific and actionable
- Provide code examples when suggesting changes
- Explain the reasoning behind feedback
- Ask questions to understand intent
- Acknowledge good practices
- Focus on the code, not the person

**DON'T:**
- Use dismissive or condescending language
- Make vague comments without specific suggestions
- Focus on personal preferences over established standards
- Ignore positive aspects of the code
- Block merges for minor style issues

### 6. Author Response Process

#### Addressing Feedback
1. **Acknowledge All Comments**: Respond to every review comment
2. **Ask for Clarification**: If feedback is unclear, ask specific questions
3. **Implement Changes**: Make requested modifications
4. **Explain Decisions**: If disagreeing with feedback, provide reasoning
5. **Update Tests**: Ensure tests reflect code changes
6. **Re-request Review**: After changes, request re-review

#### Response Templates

**For Implemented Changes:**
```markdown
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Implemented the suggested race condition fix using database 
transactions. Updated tests to verify the locking behavior.

Commits: abc123f, def456g
```

**For Questions/Clarifications:**
```markdown
‚ùì **Question**: Regarding the auto-forfeit timeout, should this be configurable 
per tournament type? Tournament admins might want different timeout periods.

I can implement a default 30-second timeout for now and make it configurable 
in a follow-up PR if that works.
```

**For Disagreements:**
```markdown
ü§î **Discussion**: I opted for the current approach because:
1. It maintains backward compatibility with existing tournaments
2. The performance impact is minimal based on our current load
3. The complexity of the suggested approach might not be justified yet

Would you be open to keeping this as-is for now and revisiting in a future 
optimization cycle? Happy to discuss further.
```
