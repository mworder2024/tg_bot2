## 📋 Test-Driven Development Guidelines

### TDD Cycle Implementation

1. **🔴 RED:** Write failing test first
   ```typescript
   describe('Game Logic', () => {
     it('should determine rock beats scissors', () => {
       expect(determineWinner('rock', 'scissors')).toBe('player1');
     });
   });
   ```

2. **🟢 GREEN:** Write minimal code to pass
   ```typescript
   function determineWinner(move1: string, move2: string): string {
     if (move1 === 'rock' && move2 === 'scissors') return 'player1';
     // Minimal implementation
   }
   ```

3. **🔵 REFACTOR:** Improve while keeping tests green
   ```typescript
   function determineWinner(move1: GameMove, move2: GameMove): GameResult {
     // Full implementation with proper types and logic
   }
   ```

### Testing Best Practices

- **Test Isolation:** Each test independent and repeatable
- **Clear Naming:** Descriptive test names explaining behavior
- **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Structured test organization
- **Mock External Dependencies:** Isolated unit testing
- **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Include boundary conditions
